REDACTED!
What You'll Be Building
Hiding information is a major part of programming: protecting passwords, establishing secure connections, and securing programs against tampering all rely on controlling access to information.

While we won’t be able to really dig into information hiding until after we cover hashes in a later course, we can write a simple program to change a user’s input with the tools we have now: arrays and iterators.
